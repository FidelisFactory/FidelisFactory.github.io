# FidelisFactory.github.io

This repository contains two things: 

- The fidelisfactory website, built using Jekyll and Github published on github pages. The source for that is on the branch [fidelisfactory-website](https://github.com/FidelisFactory/FidelisFactory.github.io/tree/fidelisfactory-website)
- Data that is shared between apps, e.g. the template database for pluspoints. This data is used by including this repository as a submodule in another repo.
